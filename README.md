dashradio-min-client
====================
v3.3.0

DR-MC is a basic web app based on Bootstrap and jPlayer which allows access to anyone on nearly any device (read: any browser that supports javascript) to listen to the high-quality, non-commerical streams provided by DJ Skee. This project also makes no money, and gives direct access to the music from every station owned by Dash, without their clunky and desktop-only flash component. This web app makes use of jQuery, HTML and AJAX.
